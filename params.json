However, if you want to build up your strength <a href=\"https://uo217.isrefer.com/go/ISMember/soawebsite/cwp3\">here's whats you should be using</a>\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2 style=\"color:white;\">HOW TO WARM UP FOR THE BEASTMODE WORKOUTS. </h2>\r\n<img src=\"http://ashotofadrenaline.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20987998716_8bebe4c99c_z.jpg\" alt=\"beast mode1\"style=\"width:640px; height:369px;\">\r\n<p style=\"color:white\">The beastmode calisthenics workout plan consists of some really intense workouts.\r\n\r\nBecause of this,<br>\r\n you will have to warm up very well before the workouts to avoid injuries and to get the most out of the workouts.<br>\r\n\r\nYour warm up should be relevant to the workout of the day.<br>\r\n Since the workouts of the beastmode workout plan can be divided into upper and lower body,<br>\r\nyou will need to have a different warm up routine for each category.<br>\r\n\r\n<b>UPPER BODY WORKOUT WARM UP SAMPLE</b><br>\r\n\r\nThis warm up is completely focused on upper body exercises.<br>\r\n If you want to follow a more general full body warm up,\r\n you can add some lower body exercises as well.</p>\r\n <ol style=\"color:white;\">\r\n <li>A1: 10 shoulder dislocations</li>\r\n <li>A2: 10 jumping jacks</li>\r\n<li> A3: 20 mountain climbers</li>\r\n\r\n <li>B1: (5-10) fingertip knee push ups</li>\r\n <li>B2: (5-10) active hang</li>\r\n </ol>\r\n <p style=\"color:white;\"> Notes\r\n<ul style=\"color:white;\">\r\n<li>You should go from A1 to A3 and B1 to B2 without rest between the exercises.</li>\r\n<li>The shoulder dislocations should be performed with good form and under control.<br>\r\n   Do not over stress yourself or be too fast with the exercise. The goal is to get the blood flowing.</li>\r\n<li>After completing one round rest 30-60 seconds. Repeat 3 rounds.</li>\r\n<li>Rest 30-60 seconds between A and B.</li>\r\n<h3 style=\"color:white;\">LOWER BODY WORKOUT WARM UP SAMPLE</h3>\r\n<p style=\"color:white;\">Similarly to the upper body warm up, your lower body warm up is going to consist only of lower body exercises.</p>\r\n<ol style=\"color:white;\">\r\n<li>1-2 min glute foam rolling or glute stretch</li>\r\n\r\n<li>10 hip cycles both sides and direction</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Squat Clinic 1.0 or 2.0</li>\r\n\r\n<li>3-5 min jump rope</li>\r\n\r\n<li> rest 30-60 seconds between A, B, C and D.</li> <ol>\r\n\r\n  <p style=\"color:white;\"> After completing your warm up you should rest 30-60 before starting with your main workout.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"color;white\">THE BEASTMODE 30 DAY CALISTHENICS WORKOUT PLAN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:white;\">This workout plan is brutal. It will work your entire body over the course of the week.\r\n   If you are eating clean and getting the proper macronutrients (As a heads up: I’m coming out with an ebook soon that will explain exactly how to do this for muscle growth.) than you’ll be looking chiseled in no time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:white;\">\r\nAll of the weeks are the same so after you finish week one go through it again on the subsequent weeks. One “set” is all of the exercises listed.\r\n<br> You need to go from one exercise to the next without rest.\r\n<br> If you have to rest either after an exercise or in between an exercise because you can’t make it to the full amount of reps than thats fine.\r\n<br> But really push yourself to do all of the exercises without rest.<br> You’re only rest period should be in between sets and after the workout is done. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",
