<p>To make things clear, I am going to discuss a little
of what to expect from this training program.<br> This way you will know if this plan fits your
<a href="http://ashotofadrenaline.net/how-to-choose-the-right-bodyweight-training-plan/">current training goals</a>
</p>

<p>First of all this is a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBtPpoo4lHY">hybird training plan</a>
, meaning that it targets more than one quality.</p>
<p>The main focus is of course<a href="http://ashotofadrenaline.net/bodyweight-hypertrophy/">buliding muscle</a>
  However, by following this plan,<br> you are going to increase your muscle <a href="http://ashotofadrenaline.net/amazing-human-feats/">endurance</a>
    ,<a href="http://ashotofadrenaline.net/bodyweight-circuits/">burn fat</a> and develop your <a href="http://rosstraining.com/blog/train-the-body-the-mind-will-follow/">mental toughness</a>
    as well .
    </p><hr>
    <p>In addition, while the beastmode program will help you<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3FaKt3mNFA">grow stronger</a><br>
      , you shouldn’t expect much in terms of maximal strength. However, if you want to build up your strength <a href="https://uo217.isrefer.com/go/ISMember/soawebsite/cwp3">here's whats you should be using</a>

<p>The beastmode calisthenics workout plan consists of some really intense workouts.

Because of this,<br>
 you will have to warm up very well before the workouts to avoid injuries and to get the most out of the workouts.<br>

Your warm up should be relevant to the workout of the day.<br>
 Since the workouts of the beastmode workout plan can be divided into upper and lower body,<br>
you will need to have a different warm up routine for each category.<br>

<b>UPPER BODY WORKOUT WARM UP SAMPLE</b><br>

This warm up is completely focused on upper body exercises.<br>
 If you want to follow a more general full body warm up,
 you can add some lower body exercises as well.</p>
 <ol>
 <li>A1: 10 shoulder dislocations</li>
 <li>A2: 10 jumping jacks</li>
<li> A3: 20 mountain climbers</li>

 <li>B1: (5-10) fingertip knee push ups</li>
 <li>B2: (5-10) active hang</li>
 </ol>
 <p> Notes
</p><ul>
<li>You should go from A1 to A3 and B1 to B2 without rest between the exercises.</li>
<li>The shoulder dislocations should be performed with good form and under control.<br>
   Do not over stress yourself or be too fast with the exercise. The goal is to get the blood flowing.</li>
<li>After completing one round rest 30-60 seconds. Repeat 3 rounds.</li>
<li>Rest 30-60 seconds between A and B.</li>
<h3>
<a id="lower-body-workout-warm-up-sample" class="anchor" href="#lower-body-workout-warm-up-sample" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LOWER BODY WORKOUT WARM UP SAMPLE</h3>
<p>Similarly to the upper body warm up, your lower body warm up is going to consist only of lower body exercises.</p>
</ul><ol>
<li>1-2 min glute foam rolling or glute stretch</li>

<li>10 hip cycles both sides and direction</li>

<li>Squat Clinic 1.0 or 2.0</li>

<li>3-5 min jump rope</li>

<li> rest 30-60 seconds between A, B, C and D.</li> <ol>

  <p> After completing your warm up you should rest 30-60 before starting with your main workout.

<p>This workout plan is brutal. It will work your entire body over the course of the week.
   If you are eating clean and getting the proper macronutrients (As a heads up: I’m coming out with an ebook soon that will explain exactly how to do this for muscle growth.) than you’ll be looking chiseled in no time.</p>

<p>
All of the weeks are the same so after you finish week one go through it again on the subsequent weeks. One “set” is all of the exercises listed.
<br> You need to go from one exercise to the next without rest.
<br> If you have to rest either after an exercise or in between an exercise because you can’t make it to the full amount of reps than thats fine.
<br> But really push yourself to do all of the exercises without rest.<br> You’re only rest period should be in between sets and after the workout is done. </p>
